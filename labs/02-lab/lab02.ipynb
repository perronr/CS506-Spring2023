    "This notebook will introduce you to the basics of Pandas and Data Visualization. You will learn how to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, how to perform basic data analysis, and how to visualize data. The first part of this notebook will be an interactive tutorial, and the second part will be practice exercises for you to do! Note that the practice problems will be checked when submitted!"
